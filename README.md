## Numerical Minimization, Parameter Fitting, and Neural Networks

This repository contains the following program(s):

- `HW10/Minimize.x` : minimizes a negative gaussian with x mean = pi and
                      y mean = 0 and outputs the results [C++]

### Requirements

In order to compile (by typing `make`) and run the C++ examples, you
need the ROOT package installed (for visualization):
- [ROOT](https://root.cern/) (C++)

### Usage

All of the executables can be called from the
command line with the `-h` or `--help` flag, which will print the options
